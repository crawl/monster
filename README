Crawl monster descriptions
--------------------------

This repository contains the source for the monster description
command used by Gretell on ##crawl Freenode (@?).

To build it, clone a copy of the crawl-ref repository in the current
directory (./crawl-ref/crawl-ref/source) and build the binary with

$ make

If all goes well, you should have a monster-trunk binary in the
current directory that can provide monster stats.
